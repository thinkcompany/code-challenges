# Thank you!
Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to showcase my skills. I spent about 2 hours on the assessment minus the time I spent reading some of the company standards and guidelines. One thing I planned to do was to separate my total calculation into a utils file.

# To run the program
  ```sh
    cd septa-fare-calculator
  ```
  ```sh
    npm install
  ```
  ```sh
    npm start
  ```
