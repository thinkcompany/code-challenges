# Hey Think Company!

Here is a demo project with the Septa Fare Calculator component included. I worked on it for about 3 hours.

## Notes:

I realized that since October 2nd 2020, 'anytime' 10 ride fares are no longer available for purchase, so I updated the data in fares.json to reflect this.

The thing I would like to spend more time on is definitely the CSS. Working on this exercise made me realize how reliant I am upon CSS libraries, so it is an area I definitely could spend some more time on focusing on.

I was really unsure about how best to package an individual component for handoff, I did some more research and found [nwb](https://github.com/insin/nwb) which offers a streamlined dev app and an easy way to export components for npm publication. If I had known this earlier, I would have started the exercise using that.

## To Run the Demo App

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn install`

and

#### `yarn start`

to start the dev server and demo app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
