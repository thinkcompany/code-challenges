# SEPTA Rail Fare Calculator Challenge

Thank you for the opportunity to work on this challenge, I had a lot of fun! Because it was such a small widget, the weight of a framework like Angular or React didn’t seem to be worth it, so I stuck with jQuery.

It is responsive - assuming it would end up on a page with other widgets, I kept it contained within its own container, which can be adjusted as needed.

With more time I would have:

*Finished styling (especially drop-down).

*Calculated the cost for anytime tickets in groups of ten, and then add the cost for the remaining tickets, to make the calculator more accurate.

*Refactored and improved upon calculateSeptaFare() function further.

Thank you!
