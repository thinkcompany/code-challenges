# Septa Fare Calculator

## Author - Sukrit Chhabra

## How to Run?
* Make sure node is installed on your computer.
* Navigate to directory.
* Run `npm install`.
* Once install is finished, run `npm start`.
* Your local server should now be running.
* Open `localhost:8080` in your browser.
* You should see the app working.

## Notes
* The app is **responsive**, i.e., if opened on your phone (if deployed) style changes would style the app appropriately.
* You can also test this in Chrome with the Toggle Device Toolbar, which can be accessed by typing `Command + Shift + M`.
* If a special fare is selected, ex: `Anytime + Station Kiosk`, the number of tickets is disregarded and the bulk price is displayed.
* There is a note added at the bottom which tells how many tickets the special price is applicable for.
