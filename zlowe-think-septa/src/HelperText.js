      Where You Are Going: Each Regional Rail station is located in a fare zone determined by its distance from Center City Philadelphia. The station where you are boarding and traveling to will determine the zone and the price of the Ticket.
      Time of Day or Day of Week You Are Traveling: Tickets are priced based on whether you will travel on a Weekday, Evening, or Weekend. Weekday hours are Monday through Friday, between 4:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. Evening hours are Monday through Friday after 7:00 p.m. Weekend hours are all day Saturday, Sunday, and on major holidays.
